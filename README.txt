Responsive.io is a service that optimizes and delivers perfect images for every screen.

We automatically pull images from your website, resize and optimize them for your visitors to speed up load time.

The plugin will make sure your tags are ready and that our javascript is loaded. All that unobtrusively without changing the content in your database.

Features:

- Images are automatically resized to fit any device.
- Our global CDN delivers your images in milliseconds.
- Retina support. High quality images for high density screens.
- We use WebP, progressive JPG and clever optimizations to make your images smaller.
- Our servers cache your images so they are ready to be served in all sizes.
- No watermarks, no user-agent sniffing, no cookies, no extra HTTP requests. No bullshit.
